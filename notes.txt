// MySQLi Extension (MysQL Improved) is a relational database driver used in the PHP scripting language to provide an interface with
 MYSQL protocol compatible databasees (MariaDB, MYSQL etc).

 The MySQLi function allows you to access MySQL database servers.

 There are three main API options when considering connecting to a MySQL database:
 - PHP's MySQL Extenstion
 - PHP's MySQLi Extension
 - PHP's Data Object (PDO)


 // Used functions for this project
 connect() - 
 connect_error() - returns the error description from the last connection error.
 real_escape_string() - Escapes special characters in a string for use in SQL statement.
 query() - Performs an SQL query against a database
 mysqli_run() - 
 num_rows() - checks and returns the number of rows/records in the database table


 exit() function: Used whenever you need to end a script with no further work
    takes maximum of 1 argument.

// Including files in PHP
- include 'filename.php';   -- Pulls the file here
- indlude_once "filename.php";  -- Pull the file in here unless it 
   has already been pulled in before
- require "filename.php";  -- Pull in the file here and die if it is missing.
- require_once "filename.php";  -- 
- These can look like functions :: require_once("filename.php");
